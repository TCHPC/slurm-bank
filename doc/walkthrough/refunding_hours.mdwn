If a job has failed you may want to refund the hours that the job
has used, to do this you need to know the job id.

	$ sbank refund job -j 5345

The refund command will look up slurmdbd, look up the account and
the elapsed time. The elapsed time will be deposited back to the
account where it originally ran from.

In general this should be left as a people issue.
