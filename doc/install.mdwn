To install slurm-bank

## Requirements

A working SLURM installation with perl and bash, we assume that
slurmdbd is setup and functioning correctly.

[[!inline pages="walkthrough/setup" template=bare]]

## Installing on a RHEL5x or clone

If you have a release tarball, and have ikiwiki installed

	$ rpmbuild -ta slurm-bank-1.0.tar.gz

or else if you do not have ikiwiki you can do

	$ rpmbuild -ta --without docs slurm-bank-1.0.tar.gz

Once the RPM's are created you can simply install the RPM's

## Installing on a generic Linux system

	$ tar zxvf slurm-bank-1.0.tar.gz
	$ cd slurm-bank-1.0
	$ make install

To install the html documentation,

	$ make install-docs

The html documentation requires ikiwiki to be installed.

## Documentation / inline help / man pages

Once the package is installed users and admins can do following to get
inline help

	$ man sbank

or

	$ sbank help

## Tests

There are some simple [[tests]] which can be run,

	make test

the tests need more work and documentation such that if the scripts are
re-implemented in C/Perl or whatever language we can verify that the
behaviour is correct.
